<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION
WAIVER</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You and Optimal Health &amp; Wellness Inc.
agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction
involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act (&quot;FAA&quot;), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and
that any dispute between us, including disputes by either of us against any
agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or
assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding
arbitration, except for disputes arising from an alleged violation of
intellectual property rights or breach of confidentiality, for which the
injured party may suffer irreparable harm and may seek a restraining order,
preliminary injunctive relief, an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief and/or legal remedies, and actions to enforce the decisions of
the arbitrators, for which action may be taken in any court of competent
jurisdiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION
AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO
A JURY TRIAL.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> In arbitration, a dispute is resolved
by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or
jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same
relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the
American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), and conducted under AAA's
Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes (collectively, the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect at
the time of the dispute. <b>You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms
and instructions for initiating an arbitration by visiting the AAA website at
www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879.</b> If for any reason the AAA
is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. If
you initiate an arbitration, Optimal Health &amp; Wellness Inc. will promptly
reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under
AAA's Procedures once you have notified Optimal Health &amp; Wellness Inc. in
writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Optimal
Health &amp; Wellness Inc. is the prevailing party in the arbitration,
applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to Optimal
Health &amp; Wellness Inc. including the filing fee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There shall be no right or authority for
any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported
representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury
or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to
act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of
claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator
may not consolidate more than one person's claims against Optimal Health &amp;
Wellness Inc. and may not preside over any kind of representative or class
proceeding against Optimal Health &amp; Wellness Inc.. You acknowledge that
this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any
disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to
arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited,
voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall
be null and void. <b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION
WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Optimal Health &amp; Wellness Inc.</b>
<b>IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING IF YOU HAVE ALREADY
PURCHASED A PRODUCT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS,
YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND. IF YOU HAVE
PURCHASED THE PRODUCT AT A RETAIL STORE, YOU MUST RETURN THE PRODUCT ACCORDING
TO THE STORE'S RETURN POLICY. IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED THE PRODUCT BY TELEPHONE OR
ONLINE FROM US, YOU MUST RETURN THE PRODUCT PURSUANT TO OUR RETURN POLICY AS
